# DataVisualizationTask Project with Iris Dataset and Linear Regression

**Project Purpose** 

This project explores the Iris dataset using Python, demonstrates basic dataset exploration, and applies machine learning techniques to analyze the data. The project also includes a linear regression model using a different dataset to predict salary based on years of experience. It aims to demonstrate foundational data science and machine learning skills, as well as reinforce the processes of loading, analyzing, and modeling data.

**Steps**

1. Dataset Exploration:

Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Displayed the first five rows, shape, and summary statistics for each feature.

2. Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
Printed the number of samples in both sets.

3. Linear Regression:

Used a custom dataset containing YearsExperience and Salary.
Fitted a linear regression model to predict salary based on years of experience.
Evaluated the model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test data.

**Advantages******

Structured Exploration: The project demonstrates a clear sequence of data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
Reproducibility: By utilizing widely available libraries like sklearn, the project is easy to reproduce.
Fundamental Techniques: It provides a solid foundation for understanding machine learning concepts like regression.


**Disadvantages**

Dataset Size: The Iris dataset is small, which limits the complexity and scalability of the analysis.
Limited to Basic Models: The project focuses on linear regression, which may not capture complex relationships in other datasets.


**Summary**

The DSV project focuses on loading and exploring the Iris dataset, preparing it for training and testing, and implementing a linear regression model on a different dataset. This project reinforces key data science skills, including data preprocessing, training-test splitting, and model evaluation.
